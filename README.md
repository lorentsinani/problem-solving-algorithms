Informed research techniques, Constraint Programming and SAT Problems

## Overview

This repository contains implementations of problem-solving algorithms for various combinatorial problems. The project focuses on informed research techniques, Constraint Programming, and SAT Problems. Below is a brief description of the three main folders in this repository:

Follow the instructions below to get started with each problem:

### N Queens Problem (JavaScript)

1. Navigate to the [NQueens directory](problem-solving-algorithms/NQueens).
2. Implement the A* algorithm according to the specified requirements.
3. Propose and implement an "admissible" heuristic for optimization.

### SAT Problem (Generic)

1. Go to the [SATProblem directory](problem-solving-algorithms/SATProblem).
2. Implement a solver for the SAT problem using the provided formula.

### Sudoku Solver (Java)

1. Head to the [Sudoku directory](problem-solving-algorithms/Sudoku-CP).
2. Implement the Sudoku solver using Constraint Programming techniques in Java.
